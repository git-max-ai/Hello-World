# Hello-World
Hello humans!

how are you and what about your imaginations.....i thought it would be better to joke for being happy.....or to make someone happy....
at the end of the day ....you should think about what you did wrong and how to correct it.....
a human is only the living being who earns for his hungerness....and never his stomach get completely filled......there are many other living oragnisms on the earth  ...they do not earn but no one from them is hungry as human......this is a fact that no one can understand ....
